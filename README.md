## Code and small static data files used for our 'state of the knowledge' lit review on agroforestry as an NCS.

**Contains**:

 - static files containing WoS search terms for:
   - agroforestry systems
   - natural climate solutions (and related language)
   - carbon sequestration estimates
 - a Python script to glue those terms together in order to search for:
   - literature studying agroforestry as an NCS
   - literature providing carbon sequestration estimates in agroforestry
 - an Excel file of agroforestry search terms that Sam pulled from \_\_\_WHERE?\_\_\_
 - a Python script that chopped some info out of that Excel file and processed it a bit
